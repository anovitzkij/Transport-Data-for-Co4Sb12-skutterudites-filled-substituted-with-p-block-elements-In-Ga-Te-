# Transport Data Repository for Co<sub>4</sub>Sb<sub>12</sub> Skutterudites Filled/Substituted with *p*-block Elements (In,Ga,Te)

This repository contains transport data, namely, carrier concentration, carrier mobility, Seebeck coefficient, and electrical conductivity for *n*-type Co<sub>4</sub>Sb<sub>12</sub> Skutterudites. These dataset is provided in CSV format for ease of use in data analysis tools.

## Dataset

   - File: `Transport_data_In_Ga_Te_Co4Sb12_RT.csv` (last update: January 2025)
   - Description:
     - Includes transport data for **filed/substituted** Co<sub>4</sub>Sb<sub>12</sub>-based thermoelectric materials.
     - Contains information on dopant type, carrier concentration, and mobility.

## Notes on Units
- **Hall charge carrier concentration** is given in cm⁻³.  
- **Hall charge carrier mobility** is given in cm²V⁻¹s⁻¹.
